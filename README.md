# speech-recognition-
The file "speech recognition" contains the code for opening the google site via voice.
Changes can be made in the link according the needs of the person as we can see in the file "speech recognition GaaS" ,Gaas refers to Gaming as a service and "speech recognition-Hadoop".
Also the files are coded in JUPYTER NOTEBOOK so open the files after downloading in jupyter notebook only for better clearification.
